# Task: Set Up GitHub Repository, Branching Strategy, CI/CD Skeleton

## Phase
Phase 0: Assessment and Planning (Week 2, Day 3-4)

## Description
Configure GitHub repository structure, establish branching strategy, and create a skeleton CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions.

## Objectives
- Establish Git branching strategy
- Configure repository settings and protection rules
- Create initial CI/CD workflows
- Set up automated build and test pipeline
- Document Git workflow for the team

## Prerequisites
- GitHub repository created
- Team members have repository access
- Azure resources created (for deployment targets)
- Development environment setup complete

## Dependencies
- Task 03: Team Kickoff, Tools Setup, and Access Provisioning
- Task 04: Create Azure Resources

## Tasks
1. **Repository Structure:**
   - Review current repository structure
   - Create .github directory structure
   - Set up issue templates
   - Create pull request template
   - Add CODEOWNERS file
   - Configure .gitignore for .NET 9 projects

2. **Branching Strategy:**
   - Define branching model (e.g., GitFlow, GitHub Flow)
   - Create main/develop branch structure
   - Document branch naming conventions (feature/, bugfix/, release/)
   - Establish merge strategy (squash, rebase, merge commit)
   - Document workflow in CONTRIBUTING.md

3. **Branch Protection Rules:**
   - Enable branch protection for main branch
   - Require pull request reviews (minimum 1 reviewer)
   - Require status checks to pass before merging
   - Enable "Require branches to be up to date"
   - Prevent direct pushes to main
   - Configure administrator enforcement

4. **CI/CD Pipeline - Build Workflow:**
   - Create .github/workflows/build.yml
   - Configure triggers (push, pull request)
   - Set up .NET 9 SDK installation
   - Add restore, build, and test steps
   - Configure code coverage reporting
   - Add build artifact publishing

5. **CI/CD Pipeline - PR Validation:**
   - Create .github/workflows/pr-validation.yml
   - Add code quality checks (linting)
   - Run unit and integration tests
   - Check for security vulnerabilities
   - Verify code formatting
   - Add automated PR comments with results

6. **CI/CD Pipeline - Deploy Skeleton:**
   - Create .github/workflows/deploy.yml (skeleton)
   - Define deployment stages (dev, prod)
   - Set up Azure credentials (Service Principal)
   - Add manual approval gates for production
   - Document deployment process
   - Note: Full deployment steps will be implemented in Phase 4

7. **GitHub Actions Secrets:**
   - Add Azure credentials as repository secrets
   - Store connection strings for testing
   - Configure environment-specific secrets
   - Document secret management process

8. **Quality Gates:**
   - Configure status checks required for merging
   - Set up automated dependency updates (Dependabot)
   - Enable security alerts
   - Configure code scanning (CodeQL)

## Deliverables
- [ ] Branching strategy documented and implemented
- [ ] Branch protection rules configured
- [ ] Build workflow (.github/workflows/build.yml) created and tested
- [ ] PR validation workflow created and tested
- [ ] Deploy workflow skeleton created
- [ ] Repository secrets configured
- [ ] Issue and PR templates created
- [ ] CODEOWNERS file configured
- [ ] Dependabot configured
- [ ] CodeQL scanning enabled
- [ ] Git workflow documentation (CONTRIBUTING.md)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Build workflow runs successfully on push and PR
- All tests pass in CI pipeline
- Branch protection prevents direct pushes to main
- PRs require review before merging
- Code coverage reports are generated
- Deployment workflow structure is in place (even if not fully functional)
- All team members understand the Git workflow
- Documentation is clear and accessible

## Estimated Effort
2 days

## Notes
- Use GitHub Actions marketplace for pre-built actions
- Consider using composite actions for reusable steps
- Set up notifications for build failures
- Document how to run workflows locally (using act)
- Create sample PR to test all checks
- Ensure CI pipeline runs reasonably fast (< 10 minutes)
- Consider matrix builds for different configurations
- Document troubleshooting steps for common CI issues
