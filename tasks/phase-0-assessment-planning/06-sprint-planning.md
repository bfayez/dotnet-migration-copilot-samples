# Task: Sprint Planning for Phase 1

## Phase
Phase 0: Assessment and Planning (Week 2, Day 5)

## Description
Conduct sprint planning session to detail Phase 1 tasks, estimate effort, and create the initial sprint backlog.

## Objectives
- Break down Phase 1 into detailed tasks
- Estimate effort for each task
- Identify dependencies and critical path
- Create sprint backlog
- Assign initial responsibilities
- Establish sprint cadence and ceremonies

## Prerequisites
- Phase 0 tasks completed
- Team fully onboarded and trained
- Migration plan reviewed and understood
- Azure resources available for development

## Dependencies
- Task 01: Application Inventory and Dependency Analysis
- Task 02: Set Up Azure Subscription and Resource Groups
- Task 03: Team Kickoff, Tools Setup, and Access Provisioning
- Task 04: Create Azure Resources
- Task 05: Set Up GitHub Repository, Branching Strategy, CI/CD Skeleton

## Tasks
1. **Review Phase 1 Objectives:**
   - Review Phase 1 goals from migration plan
   - Clarify scope and boundaries
   - Identify potential risks
   - Review success criteria

2. **Task Breakdown:**
   - Break down Week 1 (Project Structure) into detailed tasks
   - Break down Week 2 (Controllers and Views) into detailed tasks
   - Break down Week 3 (Views and Static Files) into detailed tasks
   - Break down Week 4 (Data Layer) into detailed tasks
   - Identify atomic, testable tasks
   - Create task cards in project tracking tool

3. **Estimation:**
   - Use planning poker or similar technique for estimation
   - Estimate each task in story points or hours
   - Identify complex tasks that need further breakdown
   - Account for learning curve with new technologies
   - Add buffer for unknowns (20%)

4. **Dependency Mapping:**
   - Create task dependency graph
   - Identify critical path tasks
   - Highlight blockers and risks
   - Determine which tasks can run in parallel
   - Plan for incremental testing

5. **Sprint Organization:**
   - Define sprint duration (recommended: 2 weeks)
   - Create Sprint 1 and Sprint 2 backlogs
   - Assign tasks to team members based on expertise
   - Balance workload across team
   - Identify sprint goals

6. **Definition of Done:**
   - Define what "done" means for each task
   - Establish code review requirements
   - Define testing requirements
   - Establish documentation requirements
   - Document acceptance criteria

7. **Risk Identification:**
   - Identify technical risks for Phase 1
   - Plan mitigation strategies
   - Assign risk owners
   - Define escalation procedures

8. **Sprint Ceremonies:**
   - Schedule daily standups
   - Schedule sprint review/demo
   - Schedule sprint retrospective
   - Schedule mid-sprint check-in
   - Document ceremony formats and expectations

## Deliverables
- [ ] Detailed Phase 1 task breakdown in project tracking tool
- [ ] Effort estimates for all Phase 1 tasks
- [ ] Task dependency graph/diagram
- [ ] Sprint 1 backlog prioritized and assigned
- [ ] Sprint 2 backlog prioritized
- [ ] Definition of Done documented
- [ ] Risk register for Phase 1
- [ ] Sprint ceremony schedule
- [ ] Sprint 1 goal statement
- [ ] Team capacity planning document

## Acceptance Criteria
- All Phase 1 tasks from migration plan are represented in backlog
- Each task has acceptance criteria defined
- Estimates are reasonable and agreed upon by team
- Dependencies are clearly identified and documented
- Sprint backlog is achievable within sprint duration
- All team members understand their assignments
- Definition of Done is clear and measurable
- Risk mitigation strategies are in place

## Estimated Effort
1 day

## Notes
- Use collaborative estimation techniques (planning poker)
- Consider team velocity if known from previous projects
- Keep sprint backlog flexible to accommodate learnings
- Don't over-commit in first sprint while team is ramping up
- Schedule regular backlog refinement sessions
- Use burndown charts to track progress
- Document assumptions made during planning
- Plan for knowledge sharing and pair programming
- Consider dedicating time for learning .NET 9 features
- Keep first sprint slightly lighter to account for setup overhead
