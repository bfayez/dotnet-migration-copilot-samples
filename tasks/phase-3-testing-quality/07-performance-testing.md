# Task: Performance Testing and Optimization

## Phase
Phase 3: Testing and Quality (Week 2)

## Description
Perform performance testing, identify bottlenecks, and optimize application performance.

## Objectives
- Run load tests
- Identify bottlenecks
- Optimize queries
- Improve response times
- Document performance benchmarks

## Dependencies
- Phase 3: Task 06 - Add Health Checks and Security Hardening

## Tasks
1. Set up load testing tool (Apache JMeter, k6, or Azure Load Testing)
2. Create load test scenarios
3. Run baseline performance tests
4. Identify slow queries using Application Insights
5. Optimize N+1 queries with .Include()
6. Add AsNoTracking() to read-only queries
7. Consider adding caching (optional)
8. Re-run performance tests
9. Document performance improvements
10. Establish performance benchmarks

## Estimated Effort
2-3 days

## Acceptance Criteria
- Load tests completed
- Bottlenecks identified and resolved
- Queries optimized
- Performance benchmarks documented
- Response times acceptable
