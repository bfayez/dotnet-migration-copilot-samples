# DotNet Migration Copilot Samples

## Samples:

- [ContosoUniversity](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/dotnet-migration-copilot-samples/tree/main/ContosoUniversity): This is a university management application built on .NET Framework 4.8 with traditional Windows infrastructure dependencies and runs on on-premises Windows-based hosting. After migration, the app will run on Azure Container Apps and leverage Azure SQL Database for data persistence, Azure Service Bus for reliable messaging and notifications, and Azure Blob Storage for teaching material file uploads, replacing the current MSMQ and local file system dependencies with cloud-native Azure services.
