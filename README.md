# DotNet Migration Copilot Samples

## Samples:

- [ContosoUniversity](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/dotnet-migration-copilot-samples/tree/main/ContosoUniversity): This is a university management application built on .NET Framework 4.8 with traditional Windows infrastructure dependencies and runs on on-premises Windows-based hosting. After migration, the app will run on Azure Container Apps and leverage Azure SQL Database for data persistence, Azure Service Bus for reliable messaging and notifications, and Azure Blob Storage for teaching material file uploads, replacing the current MSMQ and local file system dependencies with cloud-native Azure services.

## Migration Planning

This repository includes a comprehensive migration plan with **47 detailed tasks** organized into **6 phases**:

- **Phase 0**: Assessment and Planning (2 weeks, 6 tasks)
- **Phase 1**: Foundation - Core Migration (4 weeks, 13 tasks)
- **Phase 2**: Azure Services Integration (3 weeks, 12 tasks)
- **Phase 3**: Testing and Quality (2 weeks, 7 tasks)
- **Phase 4**: Deployment and Cutover (1 week, 5 tasks)
- **Post-Migration**: Enhancements (Ongoing, 4 tasks)

### ðŸ“‹ Creating GitHub Issues from Tasks

To track your migration progress, convert the task files into GitHub Issues:

#### Quick Start (Recommended)
```bash
# One-command setup - creates labels and all 47 issues
./setup-issues.sh
```

This interactive script will:
- âœ… Check your GitHub CLI authentication
- âœ… Create all necessary labels
- âœ… Create all 47 issues with proper formatting
- âœ… Provide next steps

#### Alternative Methods
- **Manual Steps**: Run `./create-labels.sh` then `./create-issues.sh`
- **GitHub Actions**: Use the "Create Migration Issues" workflow in the Actions tab
- **Custom**: Follow the [Issue Creation Guide](./ISSUE_CREATION_GUIDE.md)
- **Quick Reference**: See [QUICK_START.md](./QUICK_START.md)
