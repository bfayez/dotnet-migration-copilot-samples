## How to Create Issues

### Method 1: Using GitHub CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Authenticate with GitHub
gh auth login

# Run the generated script
./create-issues.sh
```

### Method 2: Using the Web UI
1. Go to the repository's Issues page
2. Click "New Issue"
3. Use the data from `issues-data.json` to create each issue:
   - Copy the title
   - Copy the body (markdown content)
   - Add the labels
4. Repeat for all 47 tasks

### Method 3: Using GitHub API
Use the `issues-data.json` file with a script that calls the GitHub API to create issues programmatically.

## Next Steps

After creating the issues:
1. Review all created issues
2. Link dependencies between issues (use GitHub issue references like #1, #2, etc.)
3. Add issues to a GitHub Project board for tracking
4. Assign issues to team members as needed
5. Organize issues by milestone if needed
